				<p classs="text-justify" style="margin-top:15px;">
					My name is Jon Winnie and my journey to start Winnie Industries began many years ago.  Having worked for other giants in the manufacturing industry, I learned a lot about what it takes to delivery a great product, on time at reasonable prices.  With my heavy engineering background, and an entrepreneurial mind; I set off on a mission to manufacture unique magnetic wire and cable management products along with some basics.  With experience in manufacturing, expertise in engineering and background in business, I hope to deliver quality products at reasonable prices to the wire and cable management market; through the distribution channels.  I believe in our products so much that I put our family name on it!
